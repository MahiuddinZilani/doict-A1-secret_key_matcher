# 2.What is Event Bubble and Event Delegation in JS?
## Answer:
## Event Bubbling

Event bubbling is a mechanism where an event starts at the most specific element (the target) and then flows upward through the DOM hierarchy to the least specific element.

### Example

**HTML**
```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>
```
**Javascript**
```javascript
const childButton = document.getElementById('child');
const parentDiv = document.getElementById('parent');

childButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Child button clicked');
});

parentDiv.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Parent div clicked');
});
```
If you click the button, both the childButton and parentDiv event handlers will be executed, with the child's handler firing first due to event bubbling.

## Event Delegation
Event delegation is a technique that leverages event bubbling to handle events on multiple elements efficiently. Instead of attaching event listeners to each individual element, you attach a single event listener to a parent element. When the event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent, and the parent's event handler can determine which child element was the target. Â  

### Example:
**HTML**
```HTML
<ul id="list">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
**Javascript**

```JavaScript
const list = document.getElementById('list');

list.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(event.target.textContent + ' clicked');
  }
});
```

In this example, we've attached a click event listener to the ul element. When a li element is clicked, the event bubbles up to the ul, and we can check the event.target property to determine which li was clicked.

# 3. What is the difference between localstorage , session storage and cookies?
## Answer
These three mechanisms are used to store data on the client-side.
| Feature           | localstorage   |  session storage  |    cookies      |
| :---------------- | :----------:   |   :------------:  |:---------------:|
| Persistence       |  Long term     |   Session based   |  Customizable   |
| Scope             |All tabs/windows|Current tab/window |Domain/path-based|
| Capacity          | Large (5MB)    |     Large (5MB)   |   Small (4KB)   |
